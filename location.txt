In space, in a supervoid
In space, orbiting a planet
In space, orbiting a moon
In space, orbiting a star
In space, spiraling into a black hole
In space, asteroid field
In space, a field of space junk
Is space, held in the tractor beam of an pirate vessel
Is space, aimlessly drifting with no fuel
Is space, caught in the crossfire of an unrealated skirmish
Is space, spinning uncontrollably.
Crashed, partially buried under sand dunes in a sprawling desert
Crashed, submerged deep in a planetâ€™s ocean
Crashed, into a city center
Crashed, into a treasured national monument
Crashed, discovered deep in a jungle on Sigma Zero
Crashed, on a busy freeway.
Crashed, into a passenger vessel.
Crashed, unearthed alongside Aztec ruins
Crashed, precariously perched atop a snowy mountain
Crashed, into an asteroid
