In space, in a supervoid
In space, orbiting a planet
In space, orbiting a moon
In space, orbiting a star
In space, spiraling into a black hole
In space, asteroid field
In space, a field of space junk

Crashed, partially buried under sand dunes in a sprawling desert
Crashed, submerged deep in a planetâ€™s ocean
Crashed, into a city center
